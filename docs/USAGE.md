# Usage guide

How to integrate **trustbridge-action** into your repository workflows.

Related docs: [README](../README.md) · [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) · [Error handling](ERROR_HANDLING.md)

---

## Prerequisites

1. A GitHub repository with Actions enabled
2. A Stellar **G-address** to validate (contributor wallet)
3. Workflow permissions allowing issue comments

---

## Basic workflow — issue assignment

```yaml
name: Verify Stellar wallet on assignment

on:
  issues:
    types: [assigned]

jobs:
  trustbridge:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      issues: write
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: Stellar-TrustBridge/trustbridge-action@v1
        with:
          stellar_address_input: GCONTRIBUTORADDRESSHERE
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Replace `GCONTRIBUTORADDRESSHERE` with your project's method of obtaining the address (see [Extracting addresses](#extracting-stellar-addresses-from-issues)).

---

## Manual run — workflow_dispatch

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      stellar_address:
        description: 'Stellar G-address'
        required: true

jobs:
  trustbridge:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      issues: write
    steps:
      - uses: Stellar-TrustBridge/trustbridge-action@v1
        with:
          stellar_address_input: ${{ github.event.inputs.stellar_address }}
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          fail_on_missing: false   # warn only for manual checks
```

> **Note:** Comments are only posted when the workflow runs in an **issue** context. For standalone `workflow_dispatch` without an open issue, checks still run and outputs are set; comment posting is skipped with a warning.

---

## Combined trigger (assigned + manual)

Matches the action design target:

```yaml
on:
  issues:
    types: [assigned]
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      stellar_address:
        description: 'Stellar G-address (manual runs)'
        required: true
      issue_number:
        description: 'Optional issue number for context'
        required: false

jobs:
  trustbridge:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      issues: write
      contents: read
    steps:
      - name: Resolve address
        id: addr
        run: |
          if [ "${{ github.event_name }}" = "workflow_dispatch" ]; then
            echo "value=${{ github.event.inputs.stellar_address }}" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
          else
            echo "value=GYOURDEFAULTORPARSEDADDRESS" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
          fi

      - uses: Stellar-TrustBridge/trustbridge-action@v1
        id: bridge
        with:
          stellar_address_input: ${{ steps.addr.outputs.value }}
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Log results
        run: |
          echo "trustline_exists=${{ steps.bridge.outputs.trustline_exists }}"
          echo "xlm_balance=${{ steps.bridge.outputs.xlm_balance }}"
          echo "account_funded=${{ steps.bridge.outputs.account_funded }}"
```

---

## Custom asset (non-USDC)

```yaml
with:
  stellar_address_input: ${{ steps.addr.outputs.value }}
  asset_code: EURC
  asset_issuer: GISSUERADDRESSHERE
  min_xlm_reserve: '2.0'
  github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

---

## Testnet

Point Horizon at Stellar testnet:

```yaml
with:
  horizon_url: https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org
  asset_code: USDC
  asset_issuer: GTESTNETISSUER...
  stellar_address_input: GTESTNETADDRESS...
  github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  fail_on_missing: false
```

Use [Stellar Laboratory (testnet)](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#account-viewer?network=test) for test accounts.

---

## Warn instead of fail

For informational checks (e.g. onboarding reminders):

```yaml
with:
  fail_on_missing: false
  github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  stellar_address_input: ${{ steps.addr.outputs.value }}
```

The step succeeds with `core.warning()`; the issue comment still shows ❌ for failed checks.

## Debug mode and timeout

```yaml
with:
  github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  stellar_address_input: ${{ steps.addr.outputs.value }}
  debug_mode: true
  horizon_timeout_ms: 20000
```

- `debug_mode: true` enables extra action logs for troubleshooting.
- `horizon_timeout_ms` controls Horizon request timeout in milliseconds.

## Sticky comments across re-runs

```yaml
with:
  github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  stellar_address_input: ${{ steps.address.outputs.address }}
  sticky_comment: true   # default — update the previous comment instead of posting a new one
```

Set `sticky_comment: false` if you want a new comment posted on every run instead (e.g. for a full audit trail). See [Comment guide](COMMENT_GUIDE.md) for details on how the prior comment is located.

## Waiting for the account to be funded

```yaml
with:
  github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  stellar_address_input: ${{ steps.address.outputs.address }}
  wait_until_funded: true
  wait_until_funded_timeout_ms: 120000
  wait_until_funded_interval_ms: 5000
```

Use this when contributors are expected to fund their wallet right after assignment. The action polls `GET /accounts/{id}` every `wait_until_funded_interval_ms` until it stops 404ing or `wait_until_funded_timeout_ms` elapses, then proceeds exactly as it would for a single check (comment, outputs, `fail_on_missing`). Non-404 Horizon errors (rate limits, outages, timeouts) are not retried by the polling loop — the existing per-request retry/backoff in `horizon.ts` handles those, and if they're still failing after that, the run fails fast instead of continuing to poll.

## New output: `comment_url`

When the action runs in an issue context, it sets `comment_url` to the created GitHub comment URL.

```yaml
- name: TrustBridge check
  id: trustbridge
  uses: Stellar-TrustBridge/trustbridge-action@v1
  with:
    stellar_address_input: ${{ steps.address.outputs.address }}
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

- name: Capture comment URL
  run: echo "Comment URL: ${{ steps.trustbridge.outputs.comment_url }}"
```

---

## comment_mode — dry-run and off (Wave #30)

By default TrustBridge posts (or upserts) a Markdown comment on the issue after every run. Set `comment_mode` to skip that GitHub API call while still running all validation checks and setting all outputs.

| Value | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| `post` | **(default)** Post or upsert the comment normally. |
| `dry-run` | Run all checks, set all outputs, but skip the GitHub API comment call. `comment_url` output is always empty. |
| `off` | Same as `dry-run` — comment posting is permanently disabled for this step. Use when you want to make the intent explicit (e.g. scheduled health-check workflows). |

### When to use dry-run

- **CI smoke tests** — verify validation logic in PR pipelines without spamming the issue timeline.
- **Preview jobs** — run TrustBridge in a pre-release dry-run job to confirm the action bundle is working before tagging.
- **Scheduled health checks** — periodic checks on wallet readiness without writing new comments on every cron tick.

```yaml
- uses: Stellar-TrustBridge/trustbridge-action@v1
  with:
    stellar_address_input: ${{ steps.address.outputs.address }}
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    comment_mode: dry-run    # validate + set outputs, skip comment
    fail_on_missing: false
```

The `comment_url` output is `''` in `dry-run` and `off` modes. All other outputs (`account_funded`, `trustline_exists`, `xlm_balance`) are set exactly as they would be in `post` mode.

### dry-run in downstream conditional steps

```yaml
jobs:
  preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - id: bridge
        uses: Stellar-TrustBridge/trustbridge-action@v1
        with:
          stellar_address_input: ${{ steps.addr.outputs.value }}
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          comment_mode: dry-run

      - name: Gate on validation result
        if: steps.bridge.outputs.account_funded == 'true'
        run: echo "Account is funded — safe to proceed"
```

---

## dashboard_webhook_url — validation telemetry (Wave #38)

When `dashboard_webhook_url` is set, TrustBridge POSTs a compact JSON summary of every validation run to that endpoint. This works in **all** `comment_mode` values including `dry-run` and `off`, making it suitable for dashboards, Slack alerts, and release automation that need a machine-readable signal without a GitHub issue comment.

```yaml
- uses: Stellar-TrustBridge/trustbridge-action@v1
  with:
    stellar_address_input: ${{ steps.address.outputs.address }}
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    comment_mode: dry-run
    dashboard_webhook_url: ${{ secrets.TRUSTBRIDGE_WEBHOOK_URL }}
```

### Webhook payload

```json
{
  "validation": {
    "ready": true,
    "accountFunded": true,
    "trustlineExists": true,
    "xlmBalance": "10.0000000",
    "xlmReserveMet": true,
    "failedChecks": 0,
    "passedChecks": 3,
    "totalChecks": 3,
    "failedLabels": []
  },
  "config": {
    "assetCode": "USDC",
    "assetIssuer": "GA5Z...KZVN",
    "minXlmReserve": 1.5
  },
  "stellarAddressRedacted": "GAAA...AWHF",
  "commentMode": "dry-run",
  "commentUrl": "",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Privacy guarantee:** Raw Stellar addresses are never included in the payload. `stellarAddressRedacted` contains only the first-4/last-4 characters (`GAAA...AWHF`).

If the webhook call fails (network error, non-2xx response), TrustBridge emits a `core.warning` and continues — a webhook failure never fails the action step.

## Extracting Stellar addresses from issues

Common patterns:

### Issue template field

Parse a labeled line from the issue body:

```yaml
- name: Extract Stellar address
  id: stellar
  uses: actions/github-script@v7
  with:
    script: |
      const body = context.payload.issue?.body ?? '';
      const match = body.match(/Stellar address:\s*(G[A-Z2-7]{55})/i);
      if (!match) core.setFailed('No Stellar address found in issue body');
      core.setOutput('address', match[1]);
```

### Assignee-linked profile

Fetch a custom field or org profile via your own API step, then pass the result to `stellar_address_input`.

## Outputs in downstream jobs

```yaml
jobs:
  verify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      funded: ${{ steps.bridge.outputs.account_funded }}
    steps:
      - id: bridge
        uses: Stellar-TrustBridge/trustbridge-action@v1
        with:
          stellar_address_input: G...
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

  payout:
    needs: verify
    if: needs.verify.outputs.funded == 'true'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Ready for payout pipeline"
```

---

## Pinning versions

| Reference | When to use |
| --------- | ------------- |
| `@v1` | Recommended for production (semver major) |
| `@main` | Latest development — use for testing only |
| `@abc1234` | Pin to commit SHA for maximum reproducibility |

---

## Permissions reference

```yaml
permissions:
  issues: write    # required for comments
  contents: read   # standard for checkout-less actions
```

If using `GITHUB_TOKEN`, no extra secret is required beyond workflow permissions.
