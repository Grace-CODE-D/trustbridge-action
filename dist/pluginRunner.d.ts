 * forward-looking extension point for new checks.

/**
 * Run every plugin registered in `registry` against `ctx`, then
 * compose their `CheckPluginResult`s into a `ValidationResult`.
 *
 * Composition rules
 * -----------------
 * - `valid`           — true only when every plugin passes.
 * - `accountFunded`   — derived from the plugin whose id ends with
 *                       `'account-funded'`, otherwise falls back to
 *                       `ctx.account !== null`.
 * - `trustlineExists` — derived from the plugin whose id ends with
 *                       `'trustline'`, otherwise `false`.
 * - `xlmBalance`      — taken from the native balance on `ctx.account`,
 *                       or `'unknown'` when `ctx.account` is null.
 * - `xlmReserveMet`   — derived from the plugin whose id ends with
 *                       `'xlm-reserve'`, otherwise `false`.
 * - `checks`          — one `CheckResultItem` per plugin, in
 *                       registration order.
 * - `remediation`     — all non-empty plugin `remediation` strings
 *                       joined with `'\n\n'`, or `undefined` when all
 *                       checks pass.
 *
 * @param ctx       Context object shared across all plugins.
 * @param registry  Optional registry; defaults to `defaultRegistry`.
