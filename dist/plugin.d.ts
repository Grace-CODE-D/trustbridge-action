 * -----------------
 * Plugins are TypeScript modules reviewed and merged by maintainers.
 * They MUST NOT evaluate or execute content sourced from issue bodies,
 * comment text, environment variables, or any other runtime-supplied
 * string as code (no `eval`, `new Function`, dynamic `import()` of
 * user-supplied paths, or shell execution of untrusted strings).
 * All plugin inputs arrive through the typed `CheckPluginContext` and
 * outputs are constrained to `CheckPluginResult` — no escape hatches.
